Welcome

Welcome to Risk - the Ultimate Battle! It is the game of 2 to 6 generals, represented by each player.
Your task will be to eliminate all other players and to stay the last on the global map.
1===============================================
Overview

At the start of each one of your turns, you will receive additional units, which you will
place on the board to reinforce your army. Then you will attack your enemies, if you want.
After you are done with combat, you will get one chance to relocate some of your units.
2===============================================
Interface

1 - Top panel which shows current player and turn phase.
2 - Side panel which is used to give your orders.
3 - World map where territories are represented by colored rectangles.
They are all clickable, you will use them to interact with the game.

3===============================================
Step 1: receive and place reinforcements

At the start of your turn, you gain additional units to reinforce your territories.
The number of units you get will be shown on the side panel.
The math behind it is simple - you get the 1/3 (without remainder) of territories
you conquered and additional units for controlling the continents.

4===============================================
Step 1: reinforcement example

Now choose your territory on the game map and the amount of troops to send there.
If everything goes OK, troops will appear in the chosen territory.
You can choose to put all of your reinforcements into one territory or spread them out
across your territories. Remember: You must place ALL of these reinforcements.

5===============================================
Step 2: attack

You can invade from any one territory you control into an adjacent enemy territory.
Remember: territories are adjacent if they share a border, or a sea-line runs between them.
You can even attack more than one territory on your turn.
You can only invade an enemy's territory - not your own.

6===============================================
Step 2: attack example

Click on your territory and all territories you can attack will be shown.
After considering winning chances click "Attack" button on side panel.
All your troops will now attack enemy. The results will appear simultaneously.
When you end your battles for this move, click "End attack" button to end phase.

7===============================================
Step 3: fortify your position

After you are finished attacking, you get ONE fortification (or "free move") with your units.
This is not an attack; it is simply a movement from one of your territories to another.
Territories are "connected" if all the territories in between are also CONTROLLED BY YOU.
You cannot pass through enemy territories.

8===============================================
Step 3: fortifying example

Now choose one territory with at least 2 troops to transfer.
Remember: you MUST leave at least one unit behind â€” you cannot abandon a territory.
Then choose a destination from shown options and click Fortify to send them there.
Your move is now ended.

9===============================================
Winning

You win if you are the last player in the game,
meaning you control all 42 territories on the board.
You are the ruler of the world. Congrats!
