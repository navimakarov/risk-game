===============================================
WELCOME

Welcome to Risk - the Ultimate Battle! It is the game of 2 to 6 generals, represented by each player.
Your task will be to eliminate all other players and to stay the last on the global map.
===============================================
OVERVIEW

At the start of each one of your turns, you will receive additional units, which you will
place on the board to reinforce your army. Then you will attack your enemies, if you want.
After you are done with combat, you will get one chance to relocate some of your units.
===============================================
INTERFACE

1 - Top panel which shows current player and turn phase.
2 - Side panel which is used to give your orders.
3 - World map where territories are represented by colored rectangles.
They are all clickable, you will use them to interact with the game.

===============================================
Step 1: RECEIVE AND PLACE REINFORCEMENTS (1)

At the start of your turn, you gain additional units to reinforce your territories.
The number of units you get will be shown on the side panel.
The math behind it is simple - you get the 1/3 (without remainder) of territories
you conquered and additional units for controlling the continents.

===============================================
Step 1: RECEIVE AND PLACE REINFORCEMENTS (2)

Now choose your territory on the game map and the amount of troops to send there.
If everything goes OK, troops will appear in the chosen territory.
You can choose to put all of your reinforcements into one territory or spread them out
across your territories. Remember: You must place ALL of these reinforcements.

===============================================
Step 2: Attack

Attack is the main part of your turn. It is
here that you attack your opponents and
attempt to take territories from them.
You can invade from any one territory
you control into an adjacent enemy
territory. Remember: territories are
adjacent if they share a border, or a
sea-line runs between them.
You can even attack more than one territory on your turn.
You can only invade an enemy's territory ~
not your own.

===============================================

Step 3: FORTIFY YOUR Position
After you are finished attacking, you get
ONE fortification (or "free move") with
your units.

To fortify your position, take as many
units as you'd like from one of your
territories and move them to another
connected territory. (Remember: you MUST
leave at least one unit behind â€”
you cannot abandon a territory.)

Territories are "connected" if all the
territories in between are also
CONTROLLED BY YOU. You cannot
pass through enemy territories.

This is not an attack; it is simply a
movement from one of your territories
to another in order to protect your front
line or to get into position for your
next turn.

===============================================

WINNING

You win if you are the last player in the
game, meaning you control all 42 territories
on the board. You are the ruler of the world.
